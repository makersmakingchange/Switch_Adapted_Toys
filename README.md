# Switch Adapted Toys
Welcome to the Maker's Making Change resources for Switch Adapted Toys.

This repository is a collection of guides, files, and tools to help individuals and organizations modify toys for use with assistive switches. These adaptations make play more inclusive for children and adults with limited mobility, giving them the power to activate toys with the press of a buttonâ€”on their own terms.

## What You'll Find Here
 - How-To Guides: - Step-by-step instructions for adapting toys with simple tools and materials and easy-to-use template for writing toy adaptation instructions
 - Educational Resources: Information on how to switch adapt a new toy
 - Equipment lists: Complete list of adapted toys and the parts needed to adapt them
 <!-- - Workshop Materials: Handouts and presentation slides for toy hackathons and build nights -->

<!--
## Who This Is For
 - Makers and volunteers interested in assistive technology
 - Therapists and educators supporting play-based learning
 - Families looking to adapt toys at home
 - Nonprofits and schools running toy adaptation workshops
-->

## Get Involved
This repository is open source and community-driven. Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests! Whether you're documenting your own process or translating guides into another language, your contributions help make inclusive play more accessible for everyone.
